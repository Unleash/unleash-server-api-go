# Generating the client:

(optional) Update the `openapi.json` spec:

1. docker compose up
2. curl -s http://localhost:4242/docs/openapi.json | jq > openapi.json

## Generate client from opeanpi.json

```bash
./generate.sh
```

After generating the code you can use `main.go` to test it works (before running the command below start Unleash server with `docker compose up`)

```bash
go run main.go -unleash-api http://localhost:4242 -authorization *:*.unleash-insecure-admin-api-token
```

# Testing

Testing relies on a running environment. You can use docker-compose.yml file to spin up an environment with a clean state and predictable admin API token

A basic test is automatically generated by the tool (find them under `client/test`), but they don't have a default configuration and doesn't have payloads required for some of the endpoints. This is the reason why the tools marks all of them as Skip. Still they're a good starting point.

We recommend copying specific tests from `client/test` into `test` and adapting them accordingly. We've done that already for api_users_test and some of its methods
