            The list of all supported providers and their parameters for a specific Unleash instance can be found by making a GET request to the `api/admin/addons` endpoint: the `providers` property of that response will contain all available providers.

            The default set of providers can be found in the [addons reference documentation](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons). The default supported options are:
            - `datadog` for [Datadog](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/datadog)
            - `slack` for [Slack](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/slack)
            - `teams` for [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/teams)
            - `webhook` for [webhooks](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/webhook)

            The provider you choose for your addon dictates what properties the `parameters` object needs. Refer to the documentation for each provider for more information.

                                      If a feature can't be fully evaluated (that is, `strategies.result` is `unknown`),
                                      this will be `false` to align with how client SDKs treat unresolved feature states.
